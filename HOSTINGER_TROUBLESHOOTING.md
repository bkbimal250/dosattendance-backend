# Hostinger Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Current Issues & Solutions

### **Error 1: MIME Type Error**
```
Refused to apply style from 'https://dosmanagers.dishaonlinesolution.in/assets/index-CBwUF6F2.css' 
because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type
```

**Root Cause:** Server is serving HTML error page instead of CSS file

### **Error 2: 403 Forbidden**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
index-BbWYAjxf.js:1
```

**Root Cause:** Server is denying access to JavaScript files

## ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Fix

### **Step 1: Check File Upload**
1. Go to Hostinger File Manager
2. Navigate to your domain root
3. Verify these files exist:
   - `index.html`
   - `.htaccess` (make sure it's not `.htaccess.txt`)
   - `assets/` folder with CSS and JS files

### **Step 2: Fix File Permissions**
1. In Hostinger File Manager:
   - Right-click on `.htaccess` â†’ Properties â†’ Set to **644**
   - Right-click on `index.html` â†’ Properties â†’ Set to **644**
   - Right-click on `assets/` folder â†’ Properties â†’ Set to **755**
   - Right-click on CSS/JS files â†’ Properties â†’ Set to **644**

### **Step 3: Test .htaccess**
1. Create a test file: `test.txt` with content "Hello World"
2. Upload it to your domain root
3. Visit: `https://dosmanagers.dishaonlinesolution.in/test.txt`
4. If it shows "Hello World", file serving works
5. Delete the test file

### **Step 4: Check .htaccess Content**
Make sure your `.htaccess` file contains exactly this:

```apache
# Basic MIME type fixes for Hostinger
AddType text/css .css
AddType application/javascript .js
AddType application/json .json

# Enable rewrite engine
RewriteEngine On

# Handle static assets - serve them directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f
RewriteRule ^assets/ - [L]

# Handle API requests - proxy to backend
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^/api/
RewriteRule ^api/(.*)$ https://company.d0s369.co.in/api/$1 [P,L]

# Handle SPA routing - redirect to index.html
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
```

### **Step 5: Alternative Solutions**

#### **Option A: Contact Hostinger Support**
Ask them to:
1. Enable `mod_rewrite` module
2. Enable `mod_mime` module
3. Check if `.htaccess` files are being processed

#### **Option B: Use Subdirectory**
Instead of domain root, try uploading to a subdirectory:
1. Create folder: `manager/`
2. Upload all files to `manager/`
3. Access via: `https://dosmanagers.dishaonlinesolution.in/manager/`

#### **Option C: Manual MIME Type Fix**
If `.htaccess` doesn't work, ask Hostinger support to add these MIME types:
- `.css` â†’ `text/css`
- `.js` â†’ `application/javascript`
- `.json` â†’ `application/json`

### **Step 6: Test After Fixes**

1. **Test CSS File:**
   ```
   https://dosmanagers.dishaonlinesolution.in/assets/index-CBwUF6F2.css
   ```
   Should show CSS content, not HTML

2. **Test JS File:**
   ```
   https://dosmanagers.dishaonlinesolution.in/assets/index-BbWYAjxf.js
   ```
   Should show JavaScript content, not 403 error

3. **Test Main Site:**
   ```
   https://dosmanagers.dishaonlinesolution.in/
   ```
   Should load the React app without console errors

## ðŸ†˜ If Nothing Works
